# Smart Brain

This project is made with NodeJS and Express. It integrates with a PostgreSQL Database to be able to store and retrieve all the users info created on Sign Up, and with this the user with a created account can Sign In. Once logged in the user has an input box where he can copy an image URL and submit it to the Clarifai API. This API returns the position of the faces inside the image. The count of how many times the user inputs an image is also stored in the database.
